# Sort Visualiser
Building on [WorkingWithArrays](https://github.com/aminrajbanshi/Beginners-Cplusplus/tree/main/WorkingWithArrays "WorkingWithArrays"), this program visualises the various steps for sorting an array with random values.  
It draws each of the steps to visualise the process that the sort algorithm is using in order to acheive the desired outcome.  
The output is mesmerising :)
