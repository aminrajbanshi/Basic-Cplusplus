# Circle Moving
This program combines the visual aspects of [ShapeDrawing](https://github.com/aminrajbanshi/Beginners-Cplusplus/tree/main/ShapeDrawing "ShapeDrawing") and [SceneDrawing](https://www.google.com "SceneDrawing") with control flow variables that react to user inputs introduced in [NameTester](https://www.google.com "NameTester").  
An all-round more interactive and fun program :)
