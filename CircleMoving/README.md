# Circle Moving
This program combines the visual aspects of ShapeDrawing [I'm an inline-style link with title](https://www.google.com "Google's Homepage") and SceneDrawing [I'm an inline-style link with title](https://www.google.com "Google's Homepage") with control flow variables that react to user inputs introduced in NameTester [I'm an inline-style link with title](https://www.google.com "Google's Homepage").  
An all-round more interactive and fun program :)
